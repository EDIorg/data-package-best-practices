To do:

some guidelines for what is a "BP".
e.g., it's justifiable, decided on by a community. It's not just something that happened once,, eg at your org (for those, use databits to advertise). Although, some BPs do start out as a practice at only place. 


this is a test link. to a file: 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/966.pdf">link to 966.pdf</a>

This is a test link, to an image.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/EDI-logo-svg-240.png" alt="EDI logo" height="80" width="80"/>
end of img.


Page front matter controls where in the menu the page appears.

We are currently using only two sections: 
- `tut`, for BP-templates, how-tos for markdown, this page. 
- `about`, for info on how this website is generated
    - gh-pages
    - bookdown for sub-sections, so that they can be reviewd first.


To add new pages to the MAIN site, add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

To add new material to bookdown sections, see the about : link tbd
