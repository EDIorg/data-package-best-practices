## Conventions and Definitions

### Audience

This document is intended for data managers. It assumes that readers are familiar with

- the basic structure of an XML document, and the ability to edit in an XML editor like OxygenXML or XMLSpy.
- the process for contributing data to a repository. If you reached this document from a repository's help-page, contact them for more information.

### Fonts and typeface

Numbered examples of EML nodes are in fixed-width font:

```{.xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```

XML element and attribute names, XPath and references to element names in text are in bold face. Single element names are surrounded by angle brackets, as they appear in XML.

<**dataTable**>  
**/eml:eml/\@packageId**

Some recommendations have special context, e.g., an XML element or attribute may be requested by a community (e.g., LTER), or required by the EDI repository (but not by other repositories).

_Context notes: Recommendations for EML usage in a specific context are called "context notes", and are placed in separate paragraphs, in italic._

### Definitions

**EML preparer**: the person responsible for "building" the EML metadata record. Generally, this is a data manager working with a project or physical site that produces data.

**Contributor**: the research project contributing the data package, e.g., an LTER or OBFS site, or a Macrosystems project. Generally, the "EML preparer" works with or for the "Contributor."

**Data package**: the EML metadata together with its entity or entities. This is generally the unit housed in repositories. We use this term to avoid confusion with the EML element "**dataset**".
