For a dataset, the abstract element can appear at the resource level or
the project level. The <**abstract**> element will be used for
full-text searches, and it should be rich with descriptive text. In
particular, descriptions should include information that does not fit
into structured metadata, and focus on the "what", "when", and "where"
information, general taxonomic information, as well as whether the
dataset is ongoing or completed. Some general methods description is
appropriate, and broad classes of measured parameters should also be
included. For a large number of parameters, use categories instead of
listing all parameters (e.g. use the term "nutrients" instead of
nitrate, phosphate, calcium, etc.), in combination with the parameters
that seem most relevant for searches.
